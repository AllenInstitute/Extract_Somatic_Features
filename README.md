# Extract_Somatic_Features
A pipeline to extract soma and nucleus features from the segmentation of precomputed EM datasets. 

This repository is designed to host all the code used to extract nucleus and soma features from precomputed cell segmentations of volumetric electron microscopy data. This implementation was designed to run on the MICrONS dataset but can be adjuested to run on similar datasets. This repository accompanies the manuscript Perisomatic Ultrastructure Efficiently Classifies Cells in Mouse Cortex (Elabbady 2024).

## Installation
The code to run this pipeline has been dockerized as lelabbady/soma_extraction:v16
